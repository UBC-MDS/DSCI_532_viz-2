# DSCI 532: Data Visualization II

Analysis, design, and implementation considerations for creating interactive data visualizations.


## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

1. Analyze interactive visualizations in terms of approaches to handling complexity: dynamic change over time, partitioning into multiple views, data reduction within a single view, and the derivation of new data.
2. Design new interactive visualizations for complex datasets.
3. Implement interactive visualizations using existing toolkits and libraries.
4. Explain the trade-offs of using animation vs juxtaposed views vs derived data.
5. Explain and justify methods to validate visualization design effectiveness including computational benchmarks, field studies on deployed software, and qualitative discussion of visual results.
